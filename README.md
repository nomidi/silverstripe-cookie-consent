simply via the Administrator Backend.

The Configuration is done via the `Settings` and the `Cookie Consent` tab.
Please keep in mind that if you are using the advanced options you will have to ensure that the Cookies and there functionality
act accordingly. With this module you are just setting the configuration for CookieConsent but it will not change the cookie behaviour.



## Todo

- If CookieConsent runs locally, add the js internally - leads right now to issues with e.replace
- Testing
